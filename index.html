    <p>Throughout the foreseeable future, I will be working on this framework. Initially, it's compatibility will lie within the Win32 API, allowing cross-compatibility between different Windows Operating System distributions of which are of x86_64 architecture of course.</p>
    <p>This project will be maintained solely by myself and is a project that I will be working on just for "fun." Obviously, I will be making it as usable as possible for not just myself but for anyone else that wishes to make use of the framework.</p>
    <p><strong><i>This Framework, so to say, is intended to be classed as a wrapper around the native APIs that run on different Operating Systems. For now, it will be a wrapper around the Win32 API until I wish to work on a variant for another OS.</i></strong></p>
    <p><strong>In it's current state, this GUI Framework is not exactly, so to speak, "usable" as it is currently under a heavy development process. If you wish to for some reason use the framework for some bizarre reason then.. You can do so? Good luck. However, I will be committing updates every time I make them at the end of each day I work on this project. For now, it is a read-only type of project, but may be a fully-usable framework in the future. </strong></p>
